# Netflix-Clone-Live
Developed a front-end web application replicating the core user interface of Netflix using HTML for structure and
organization.
• Implemented responsive design principles using CSS to ensure the application adapts to various screen sizes and
devices.
• Utilized JavaScript for dynamic features, potentially which includes interactive navigation elements (e.g.hover
effects , on hovering the window it initalizes the video)
